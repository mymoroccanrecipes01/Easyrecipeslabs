                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Lummy Hayes. I'm a self-taught home cook based in Casablanca with a passion for making delicious food accessible to everyone. I grew up in a multicultural household where my grandmother cooked traditional Moroccan dishes, and my father loved experimenting with Mediterranean flavors. That combination shaped how I approach cooking today—I respect traditional techniques, but I'm always looking for ways to make recipes simpler and faster for busy families.</p>
                
                <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
                <p>I was about 16 years old when my grandmother let me cook our family's Friday tagine completely on my own. I thought I knew what I was doing after watching her countless times. But I was impatient—turned up the heat too high, didn't seal the pot properly, and ruined the whole thing. My family's disappointment was crushing. But my grandmother didn't scold me. Instead, she sat down with me and explained why each step mattered—the low heat for even cooking, the precise layering, the timing. That day, I realized cooking isn't just about throwing ingredients together. It's about understanding the 'why' behind each decision. Now, every recipe I share has been tested and refined until I'm 100% confident it will work perfectly for you, even if it's your first time making it.</p>
                
                <h2>My Cooking Philosophy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Respect the Process:</strong> Good cooking requires patience and attention to detail. I test every recipe multiple times to ensure reliability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple Doesn't Mean Boring:</strong> Complex flavors don't require complicated techniques or hard-to-find ingredients. I believe in maximum flavor with minimum fuss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooking is for Everyone:</strong> Whether you're a beginner or an experienced cook, every recipe should be clear, achievable, and rewarding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real Ingredients, Real Food:</strong> I don't use shortcuts or artificial anything. Just honest food made with ingredients you can pronounce.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                <p>I share recipes that have earned their place on my table through rigorous testing and real-life use. Every recipe fits my three core standards: it must taste genuinely delicious, it must be achievable for a home cook, and it must deliver results every single time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mediterranean & Moroccan Dishes:</strong> Recipes inspired by the flavors I grew up with—tagines, couscous, salads, and mezze that respect traditional techniques but work with modern timing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick Family Meals:</strong> Real weeknight dinners that taste better than takeout but don't require hours in the kitchen. Tested with actual families and actual schedules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foundations & Techniques:</strong> Master recipes for sauces, stocks, and basics that unlock dozens of variations. Learn the 'why' so you can cook with confidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal & Practical:</strong> Recipes that work with what's actually available and affordable in your local markets, planned around real seasons.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why I Test Everything Multiple Times</h2>
                <p>You'll notice every recipe on this site has been tested at least 3-5 times before I publish it. I test for accuracy, for timing, for consistency across different skill levels, and for results with different ingredients. I pay attention to the details you might miss—cooking times vary with stove types, ingredient sizes matter, and sometimes a half-degree of temperature changes everything. I do this work so you don't have to worry about failure. When you make one of my recipes, it should work.</p>

                <h2>Let's Cook Together</h2>
                <p>Cooking should bring joy, not stress. My goal is to share recipes and techniques that help you create meals you're proud of, whether you're cooking for yourself or for people you love. I'm constantly learning, testing new ideas, and listening to feedback from people like you. This isn't a one-way street—your experiences and suggestions help me make better recipes.</p>
